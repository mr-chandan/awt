-- 1. Create a User (MySQL)
CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';

-- 2. Grant Permissions (MySQL)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- 3. Create a Table with a Foreign Key
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);

-- 4. Create a View
CREATE VIEW student_courses AS
SELECT Students.student_id, Students.name, Courses.course_name
FROM Students
JOIN Courses ON Students.course_id = Courses.course_id;

-- 5. Delete a View
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS student_courses;

-- 6. Mathematical Functions
SELECT name, ABS(age - 40) AS AgeDifference FROM patients;
SELECT name, RAND() AS RandomNumber FROM patients;
SELECT name, ROUND(age, -1) AS RoundedAge FROM patients;
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS LengthName FROM patients;
SELECT name, UPPER(name) AS UpperName FROM patients;

-- 7. Aggregation Functions
SELECT COUNT(patient_id) AS PatientCount FROM patients;
SELECT SUM(age) AS TotalAge FROM patients;
SELECT AVG(age) AS AverageAge FROM patients;
SELECT MAX(age) AS MaxAge FROM patients;
SELECT MIN(age) AS MinAge FROM patients;

-- 8. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;
BEGIN;
SAVEPOINT before_insert;
INSERT INTO account (account_id, account_name, balance) VALUES (102, 'Jane Smith', 2000.00);
UPDATE account SET account_name= 'NANDINI' WHERE account_id = 102;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_insert;
DELETE FROM account WHERE account_name='Jane Smith';
COMMIT;

-- 9. Locking Tables (Read and Write)
LOCK TABLES account READ;
SELECT * FROM account;
UNLOCK TABLES;
LOCK TABLES account WRITE;
UPDATE account SET balance = 2500 WHERE account_id = 2;
UNLOCK TABLES;

-- 10. Concurrent Transactions
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_name = 'John';
COMMIT;
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_name = 'John';
COMMIT;

-- 11. Set Transaction Isolation Level
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_name = 'John';
COMMIT;
